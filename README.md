# Pump-Automation-And-Fluid-Level-Monitoring
This is a project related to live monitoring and controlling the system over wireless connectivity. Here I have created an android application and  an arduinoUNO code for NodeMCU module.

This project consist of 3 phases.

1.Hardwar
In this project I have used a nodeMCU module, Ultrasonic sensors, and designed a circuit that shows the controll errors and a voltage convrter circuit that will controll the flow of 5V and 3.3V through out the circuit. 

2.Software
Here as an sofitware I have developed an android application using Android Studio Software, which will monitor as well as disply errors and can be controlled with automatic as well as manual controls.

3.Database
For connectivity and realtime monitoring of data I have used firebase Database. This database feeds the data transmitting from NodeMCU to Android Application via firebase database.

This project goal was to achieve monitoring, controling and generating reporting of live data usage of fluids from one tank to another tank.
